# Basic C++ Programs

Welcome! This repository is a growing collection of simple, beginner-friendly C++ programs. 
Each program here is designed to help new programmers understand fundamental C++ concepts through straightforward code examples. 
If you are just starting with C++, you'll find these examples helpful for learning and practice.
As I continue learning, I’ll add more programs covering different topics.

## Contents

- `add-two-numbers.cpp` — Adds two numbers and prints the result.
